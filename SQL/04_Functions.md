SQL functions are pre-defined operations that allow you to perform calculations, transformations, or other operations on data in a SQL database. They can be categorized into several types, including:

### 1. **Aggregate Functions**
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result. Theyâ€™re often used with the `GROUP BY` clause.

- **`COUNT()`**: Returns the number of rows in a dataset.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`SUM()`**: Returns the sum of numeric values.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`MIN()`** and **`MAX()`**: Return the minimum and maximum values in a dataset.
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(Salary), MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```

### 2. **String Functions**
String functions manipulate or retrieve information from text data.

- **`UPPER()`** / **`LOWER()`**: Convert text to uppercase or lowercase.
  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(Name) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`LENGTH()`**: Returns the length of a string.
  ```sql
  SELECT LENGTH(Name) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`CONCAT()`**: Concatenates multiple strings.
  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`SUBSTRING()`**: Extracts a portion of a string.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUBSTRING(Name, 1, 3) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`REPLACE()`**: Replaces occurrences of a substring with another string.
  ```sql
  SELECT REPLACE(Name, 'John', 'Jonathan') FROM Employees;
  ```

### 3. **Date and Time Functions**
Date and time functions handle date and time data types, enabling calculations and formatting.

- **`NOW()`**: Returns the current date and time.
  ```sql
  SELECT NOW();
  ```
- **`CURDATE()`**: Returns the current date.
  ```sql
  SELECT CURDATE();
  ```
- **`YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, `DAY()`**: Extracts parts of a date.
  ```sql
  SELECT YEAR(HireDate), MONTH(HireDate), DAY(HireDate) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`DATEDIFF()`**: Returns the difference between two dates.
  ```sql
  SELECT DATEDIFF('2024-11-05', '2024-01-01');
  ```
- **`DATE_ADD()`** and **`DATE_SUB()`**: Adds or subtracts an interval from a date.
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_ADD(HireDate, INTERVAL 5 DAY) FROM Employees;
  ```

### 4. **Mathematical Functions**
Mathematical functions are used to perform calculations on numeric data.

- **`ROUND()`**: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
  ```sql
  SELECT ROUND(Salary, 2) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`ABS()`**: Returns the absolute value of a number.
  ```sql
  SELECT ABS(SalaryChange) FROM Salaries;
  ```
- **`CEIL()`** and **`FLOOR()`**: Rounds numbers up or down to the nearest integer.
  ```sql
  SELECT CEIL(5.3), FLOOR(5.3);
  ```
- **`POWER()`**: Raises a number to a specified power.
  ```sql
  SELECT POWER(Salary, 2) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`MOD()`**: Returns the remainder of a division.
  ```sql
  SELECT MOD(Salary, 5) FROM Employees;
  ```

### 5. **Conditional Functions**
Conditional functions return values based on conditions.

- **`CASE`**: Used to perform conditional logic.
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      Name,
      CASE 
          WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'High'
          WHEN Salary > 30000 THEN 'Medium'
          ELSE 'Low'
      END AS SalaryLevel
  FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`IF()`** (in MySQL): Similar to `CASE`, it returns different values based on a condition.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, IF(Salary > 50000, 'High', 'Low') AS SalaryLevel FROM Employees;
  ```

### 6. **JSON Functions** (Supported in databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
JSON functions work with JSON-formatted data.

- **`JSON_EXTRACT()`**: Extracts data from JSON.
  ```sql
  SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(Preferences, '$.theme') FROM Users;
  ```
- **`JSON_SET()`**: Updates JSON data.
  ```sql
  UPDATE Users SET Preferences = JSON_SET(Preferences, '$.notifications.sms', true) WHERE UserID = 1;
  ```

### 7. **Aggregate Window Functions**
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, such as calculating running totals or averages.

- **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank FROM Employees;
  ```
- **`RANK()`** and **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Provide ranking with and without gaps.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) FROM Employees;
  ```

### Summary
SQL functions simplify data manipulation, formatting, calculations, and conditional logic, making them essential tools for querying and managing database data. By using functions, SQL allows you to transform, filter, and analyze data directly within the query, making complex operations more efficient and readable.
